I am Jinay Patel, final year student in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay ( IITB ). I will receive my Bachelor's + Master's degree in 2021. Right from the start of my study at IIT Bombay, I was always interested in Aerospace and Astronomy. Following my interest I had pursued multiple courses in these domains. In addition, I also developed interest in computing, especially in python. My immediate goal is to identify specific field to work on, where I can combine Astronomical Sciences and Aerospace Engineering. Basically, I would like to work at intersection of Astro and Aero, AESTRO.
