Hello! I am Jinay Patel, currently immersing myself in the intricate field of Aerospace Engineering as a diligent second-year Ph.D. student at the esteemed University of Texas at Arlington. My academic journey began at the highly respected Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), where I successfully completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in 2021.

The fascination with Aerospace and Astronomy has been a driving force in my life since the commencement of my academic exploration at IITB. It prompted me to undertake a comprehensive spectrum of courses in these captivating realms, deepening my understanding and augmenting my perspective about these fields.

As I delved deeper into my studies, I cultivated a burgeoning interest in computing, with a particular affinity for Python. This has added a new dimension to my academic arsenal, empowering me to approach challenges with a more technologically-savvy mindset.

Presently, my ambitions are channelled towards pinpointing a unique niche that harmoniously blends the mysteries of Astronomical Sciences with the technical depth of Aerospace Engineering. My ultimate aspiration is to pioneer in a discipline that exists at the crossroads of Astro and Aero â€“ a field I fondly call '<em>AESTRO</em>'. My journey, characterized by persistent learning and unyielding curiosity, is paving the way towards this exciting and innovative juncture.
