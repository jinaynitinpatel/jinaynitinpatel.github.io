I am Jinay Patel, a first-year Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. I received my Bachelor’s + Master’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay ( IITB ) in 2021. Right from the start of my study at IIT Bombay, I was always interested in Aerospace and Astronomy. Following my interest, I had pursued multiple courses in these domains. In addition, I also developed an interest in computing, especially in python. My immediate goal is to identify a specific field to work on, where I can combine Astronomical Sciences and Aerospace Engineering. Basically, I would like to work at the intersection of Astro and Aero, <em>AESTRO</em>.
